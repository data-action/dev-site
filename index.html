The unprecedented growth of data has generated excitement in popular media and press for its ability  using it to reshape the dynamics of everyday life. However, big data does not act on its own and will not change the world unless it is collated and synthesized into tools that people can acquire and use. The Data Action project will develop data visualizations on current events to provide examples for how anyone can use data to to expose hidden patterns and ideologies to audiences inside and outside the policy arena to encourage civic change.

                            <h2>Background On Race and the Suburbs</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Feb 13, 2015</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/module1_background/ULI_stlouis.png" alt="">
                            <p>The racial diversity of the suburbs is growing.  A <a href= "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2011/5/04%20census%20ethnicity%20frey/0504_census_ethnicity_frey.pdf">Brookings Institute study</a> from 2011 titled “Melting Pot Cities and Suburbs” looked at census data from 1990, 2000, and 2010 and discovered that half of American cities are majority non-white and that more than half all minority groups living in metro areas are now living in suburbs.  Not only is the US becoming more racially diverse in general, but also as more and more previous residents of the urban areas have the opportunity to head for the suburbs often in search of more opportunities and better resources, we see a change in the racial mix of the suburban ring around the central city. </p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/module1_background/brookings_racechange.png" alt="">
                            <p>The same Brookings study attributes these changes to three factors: 1) the relatively higher growth of minority populations in contrast to an aging white population, 2) a more diverse child population, especially in the suburbs, and 3) “black flight” of African American populations from cities.  The Urban Institute made a <a href = "http://datatools.metrotrends.org/charts/metrodata/_Blog/Maps/PovertyRace_DW/Map.html#41180,1980,2010,11,38.6839017791681,-90.31448364257812">series of very informative maps</a> that show racial change between different census decades from 1980 to 2010.   Going back to the events of Ferguson and St. Louis, which was what initially motivated us to look at this topic, we can clearly see that the black population in the central city of St. Louis lessened while the northern and southern suburbs of the city grew in their minority population.  
                            </p>
                            <p>What are the real-life implications of this change and how does this impact the way people live?  Do people have more amenities and better education but perhaps less political power because of their dispersal?  Or, perhaps, moving to the suburbs does not necessarily offer the improved opportunities and education that drove people to move there in the first place.  <a href = "http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/race-and-the-suburbs/">An article</a> by Lawrence Levy in the New York Times during the 2008 elections suggests that minorities are still segregated the suburbs; he cited that 70% of Long Island black elementary and secondary school students attended only 10% of 124 school districts, with legal action towards more equitable districting being difficult due to the numerous number of school districts in the region.  A <a href="http://www.s4.brown.edu/us2010/Data/Report/report12012014.pdf">recent study</a> by John R. Logan at Brown University reaffirms this idea and shows that blacks and Hispanics actually live in the least desirable suburban neighborhoods and only have access to the lowest performing schools, thus losing out again on the opportunities that were supposed offered to them in a suburban environment.

                            <p>We decided to investigate the effects suburban living racial dynamics within the context of Cleveland, Ohio in order to get a more nuanced and spatial understanding.  We chose Cleveland because its surburban history is as long as the city itself, and it exemplifies a city which saw a housing and industrial boom during and after World War II. </p>

                            <p>Before the 1850s, there were several independent townships and villages within Cuyahoga county, which contains the city of Cleveland.  The residents of these settlements generally tended to stay with in their communities due to lack of easy transportation.  With the development of the horse-drawn streetcar, which allowed for development up to a 3 mile radius around downtown, more and more communities began to arise near the city in order to take advantage of the city's superior public infrastructure and amenities.  The invention of the electrified increased the radius of development to 10 miles and increased the pace of village incorporation even further.  After the slowdown in suburban development during the Depression, the city saw a second wave of growth as a consequence of the World War II. Employment had increased 34% in 1944 from 1940 due to wartime production.  Because there were building restrictions and workers coming to the city during the war, the housing <a href = "http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=WWI1"> had reached 0.5% by March 1943 </a>.  Temporary housing units even had to be built to accomodate the need for housing. Due to the poorer quality housing stock in the inner city, large space requirements for construction plants, and the high demand for housing, the number of suburban communities increased quickly after the end of the War in August 1945. </p>

                            <p>After the War, with the push from the GI Bill, which provided government-guaranteed mortgages to new veterans, and the rest of the labor market following along the trend, the expansion of the suburbs around Cleveland grew dramatically. The city's older inner ring suburbs saw the most growth.  For instance in 1950, Parma, a south-western suburb of the city, nearly <a href = "http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=S25"> doubled its population </a> from 14,000 in 1931. By the 1970s, at the peak of the city's suburban population boom, the city of Cleveland had lost 127,457 residents while its suburbs gained 631,042.  Post-1970s, with the economic depression and the signs of age in Cleveland's inner ring suburbs, we see in the city a trend that appears throughout the country: population growth stagnates or declines while simulataneously getting older, the demand for better social programs increases, and physical infrastructure of the suburbs deteriorates.

                            <p>An important element to highlight in the racially segregated manner in which Cleveland's suburbs grew is the practice of redlining, which was established with the National Housing Act of 1934 and the creation of the Federal Housing Authority (FHA).  Although the history of racially-charged segregation policies in the US dates back to the 19th century, most notably in the case of <i> Yick Wo v. Hopkins </i>, wherein the Supreme Court declared that policies preventing Chinese laundry owners in San Francisco from receiving a permit to operate a laundry in a wooden building, the practice became official with creation of the FHA.  These policies would delineate areas of desirability for banks' lending purposes and were often based on assumptions about the community.

                            <h2>Module 2 - Pollution Through China's Own Lens - Scraping Chinese Social Media</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">July 15, 2015</p>

                            <p>Chinese social media is a big deal.  I went to China a few weeks ago and discovered that social media is not only the channel through which most people communicate, but it is the also how they online shop and pay money, register for events, make phone calls, amongst other things.  Social media apps such as Wechat, QQ, and Weibo are ubiquitous and essential to life in China these days.  Even Apple CEO Tim Cook has <a href = 'http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/11/apple-ceo-tim-cook-joins-weibo-chinas-twitter-like-social-network/#.wreo41:u4iC'> joined Weibo</a>, a move that not only reveals the importance of China to the western economy, but also the centrality of social media in China.  Despite its prevalence, or perhaps because of it, social media also pared with China's infamous control over information.  This can be especially notable when the subject matter is controversial. </p>
	
                            <p>In this project, we wanted to look at the portrayal of pollution in China by Chinese people to understand how they see the issue.  In doing so, we also developed a knowledge of censorship in social media, where it is tightly controlled, but also where the censors missed some things. </p>
								
							<h4>The Data-Gathering Process</h4>
                        	<p> We decided to use Weibo, a Twitter-like platform, to gather images of pollution that people captured and posted to the app.  This was partially out of convenience (they have an API) and partially due to the fact that we know Weibo monitors and censors certain topics such as pollution, so we were curious what we'd find.  As it turns out, having an API is better than having nothing, but having an API that has no content search functionality (which it disabled in version 2) esentially means you're out of luck.  So we scrapped the Weibo website instead.  For those of you unfamilar with web-scrapping, it is a technique of gathering data straight from the html code that creates a website.</p>

                            <p>To allow us further insight into the collected posts, we wanted to develop a rich, visually compelling application that would allow us to view the content of the posts, provide the ability to categorically filter by hashtags, and visualize the geographic spread of the posts. We wanted to allow for a dynamic window into the discussion of pollution as it is taking place on the ground in China through social media, using content provided in the day to day life of Chinese citizens. The visualization provides a view of "pollution through the China's own lens" using citizens as sensors on the ground.</p>

                            <h3><a href="chinas-own-lens">View the Application</a></h3>
                            <p>The solution implemented to meet these needs is an application titled <a href="chinas-own-lens">'Pollution Through China's Own Lens'</a>. The visualization accesses and displays the Weibo post data, allowing for interaction, exploration, and filtering. The visualization is a dual application, one half of it a map displaying the geography of the posts and the images, and the other half a visually engaging gallery, showing larger images and providing further information on each image.</p>

The map component displays data <strong>clustered by location</strong> across China and the world. Click on the a cluster of posts to zoom in to a specific location. You will see the clusters break down to smaller groups as you zoom in. <strong>An individual post is represented by a camera.</strong> At the bottom of the map, there is a single row of images. These images represent the posts that are within the current extent of the map. <strong>Hover over a single camera icon to locate the post you on in the row of images.</strong> The row of images will scroll to show the proper post. Click on highlighed image to see a detailed view.</p>

                            <h4 style="margin-top: 25px">Data Limitations and Assumptions</h4>
                            <p>A number of limitations were encountered in developing a solution that would work to meet our requirements. In the following, we will outline a few of the caveats and limitations that arose when working with the data. First and foremost, building an application to handle the sheer amout of data is challenging and requires filtering and scrubbing. This was addressed using pagination techniques in the gallery and by allowing only data within the current extent to be shown on the map.</p>
                            <p>In additon to the sheer amount of data, posts have limited location information and certain categories are underrepresented due to heavy censorship. This leads to certain categories that would seem to have many posts, such as <strong>#airPollution</strong> with smaller numbers, while other categories, such as <strong>#pm25</strong>, are not as heavily censored, and may have more posts, even if more people might tag <strong>#airPollution</strong> in their posts.</p>
                            <p>The location data for the posted is disaggregated to a neighborhood and city level. Locations of individual posts are not known, but a neighborhood provided in the profile is provided. These neighborhoods have been matched to latitude and longitude and then placed as point locations on the map. There are posts that were not explicitly matched to a location. By default, these points have been placed at 0 degrees latitude and 0 degrees longitude, off the west coast of Africa. In interest of transparency, this along with other posts that might be outside of China have been left in the map.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Because locations are disaggregated, many posts appear to occur in one location. This is addressed using a clustering method, where the point is labeled with the number of posts at that location. Once fully zoomed in, when clicked the point will explode out to show the individual posts at that location. You can hover over these to see the corresponding post.</p>

                            <p>The gallery revealed another data limitation. This is crowd-collected data via social media and anyone can tag anything as pollution, even if it is not pollution in the traditional sense. We have scrubbed the data to remove a number of odd images, including selfies or other images that were labelled as pollution. An example of this is shown below. While efforts were taken to scrub the data, in interest of transparency and because of the fuzzy nature of the categories, certain images have been left in the gallery and on map.</p>

                            <h4>The Data-Gathering Process</h4>
                        	<p> We decided to use Weibo, a Twitter-like microblogging platform, to gather images of pollution that people captured and posted to the app.  This was partially out of convenience (they have an API) and partially due to the fact that we know Weibo monitors and censors certain topics such as pollution, so we were curious what we'd find.  As it turns out, having an API is better than having nothing, but having an API that has no content search functionality (which it disabled in version 2) esentially means you're out of luck.  So we scrapped the Weibo website instead.  For those of you unfamilar with web-scrapping, it is a technique of gathering data straight from the html code that creates a website. </p>

							<p> The hashtags we chose are based on issues we know to be pressing in China.  For instance<a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Dust'> "Yellow Dust" </a> refers to the seasonal dust storms in East Asia, which brings sand from the deserts of of Mongolia. It has become a bigger issue in the past few years due to the pollutants contained in the dust.  Another category, "PM2.5", stands for Particulate Matter 2.5, an air pollutant that can come from automotive exhaust as well as other operations that require the burning of fuel.  In Beijing, a city known for its high levels of air pollution, <a href = 'http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/' >the city measures the concentration of PM 2.5 daily </a> as an indication of the air quality outside.  For some of the categories that we scrapped, such as "Pollution" and "Air Polution" didn't get us great results - the Weibo site had only a handful of images for each month.  Other categories such as "Haze" or "Take Pollution Pics", got us dozens of images DAILY.  When we asked our Chinese friends about this, they said that sometimes censors don't catch certain phrases.  Furthermore, sometimes people explicitly use slang to communicate about sensitive issues.  <a href ='http://www.thewire.com/technology/2012/03/slang-chinese-bloggers-use-subvert-censorship/49882/'>This article from The Wire </a> explains a little more about how slang is used to escape censorship.</p>

							<p> After we scrapped the Weibo website, when then kept only the data that were attached to a user ID in order to connect the image to information about the user themself through the Weibo API.  This gave us information such as the user's sex, age, city, followers, etc.  We used the "city" category to map the photos.  As such, the photos are a representation of where the users are from, and not necessarly where they were taken.  Nevertheless, through this process, we  were finally able to create a dataset that reflected a collection of images of how (or sometimes not!) Chinese people understand pollution through pictures.  Many images are face mask selfies, many were just city-scapes, but you barely see the buildings because of the pollution cover.  Relative to other countries, Chinese social media does not tell us too much, but even the small amount of information that it does reveal is powerful. </p>
